## Self reflection

I cast a shadow by the things I do, words I speak, and actions I take.
My self-perception of my shadow can sometimes be incomplete, and I may experience blind spots about how my shadow affects those around me.

Consider a feedback tool that gathers open, honest, and constructive feedback for self-awareness and reflection. 

```
Situation 1: In 1:1 Meetings
Situation 2: In Large Group Meetings
Situation 3: When a mistake is made
```

For each scenario, elect from a list of attributes to describe how I experience someone.
